#### Running the Test ####

1. Download the 'sketch' and place it in your arduino 'sketchbook'.
2. Download the libmathq15 *.h and *.c files and place them in /sketchbook/libraries/libmathq15/
3. Rename 'libmathq15.c' to 'libmathq15.cpp'
4. Connect an oscilloscope to pins 2 and 4
5. Run the sketch and measure the time on the oscilloscope.  Pin 2 is the 'floating-point' pin and pin 4 is the 'fixed-point' pin.
