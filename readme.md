# Q1.15 Library for 8- and 16-bit Embedded Applications #

There are a number of math libraries that support Q16.16 and some other fixed-point notations, but I have noted a distinct lack of open-source libraries for Q1.15.  In most applications, Q1.15 math will work well enough to get the job done and there should be an easy-to-use, open source, and optimized library for it.

# Contributions #

 * provide optimizations for your favorite embedded platform
 * testing (there has been no testing so far, I just wrote the lib and there are sure to be bugs)
 * expansion - add your favorite or most-used function
 * documentation - there are some comments, but not much
 
 # Future #
 
 I have personally utilized many similar routines in the past, so I plan to continue contributing in the above ways myself.  I just know that I won't be able to do everything right now, so I'm publishing the 'beginning' to the community to help out if they wish.
